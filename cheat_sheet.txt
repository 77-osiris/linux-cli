Starting out:

cd - Change directory 
examples: 
cd .. (go up a directory to the parent dir) cd /path/path (change to specific directory following the specified path)
ls (list directory contents) adding -l for long list format and -a for all including hidden files
ls -la and ls -li (-i for index number of each file, useful when looking at hard and symbolic links)
ln (make a new link) use case: ln file.ext/dir lnfile/lndir (makes a hard link) use -s to  make a symbolic link
whatis (one line descriptors for commands e.g whatis bash - GNU Bourne-Again shell)


echo can be used for a variety of purposes when it comes to producing an output to the terminal, however redirection can also be used to put to a file.
echo is compatible with numerical equations eg $(((5 * 5) *3)) produces an output of 75 to the terminal
echo can also be used with -e to produce special case escape sequences such as \a for a bell, \b for backspace, \n for newline, \r for carriage return and \t for tab
